    <p>Came across an interesting article on Wired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NEW YORK -- Amid the documentaries and live-action features at this
year's Tribeca Film Festival is a first for the event -- a
feature-length, computer-generated animated film rendered entirely
by a single animator, working out of a home office.</p>
<p>Nina Paley's Sita Sings the Blues, which makes its North American
premiere Friday at the festival, tells two parallel stories: the
ancient Hindu epic the Ramayana and the breakup of Paley's
21st-century marriage. It does so through four distinct styles of
animation, a &quot;greek chorus&quot; of Indonesian shadow puppets and wildly
imaginative musical interludes that use authentic 1920s blues
recordings to link narratives 3,000 years apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article has got an interview of Nina Paley as well as a trailer of
the film.</p>
<p>From what I read from the article, it features Rama leaving Sita.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wired:</strong> You voiced the role of yourself, and that leads to the
film's most excruciating scene, in which your character asks your
husband to take you back.</p>
<p><strong>Paley:</strong> [Laughs.] Isn't that pathetic? I wanted people to <em>feel
my pain</em>. And believe me, that's just a little taste of it.
[Laughs.] When this sort of thing happens to you, it's so shameful,
so humiliating. Which is why I included that scene of Sita sitting
there on the banks of the river saying, &quot;I must have committed a
terrible sin in a previous life to deserve such suffering.&quot; There's
always a sense that, if something bad happens to you, that there's
something really wrong with you. And I love that even Sita believes
this, because she's completely stainless, that's the whole point of
her character. I feel that airing this stuff out is the way to take
the shame out of it. Plus, pain is funny!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ramayana says that Rama chose to leave Sita because of his duty as a
king. In the otherwise spotless character of Rama, I feel, this is a
huge blemish. And so do a lot of people. Many &quot;experts&quot; though have felt
otherwise.</p>
<p>Should be interesting to see how Ramayana and the character of Sita is
treated in this film.</p>
