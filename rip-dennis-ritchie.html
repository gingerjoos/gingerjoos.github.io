    <p>This is a bad bad month for technology. First it was <a class="reference external" href="http://gingerjoos.com/blog/news/rip-steve">Steve
Jobs</a>, now it is reported
that Dennis Ritchie (dmr) is no more. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob
Pike</a> has posted that <a class="reference external" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP?hl=en">Dennis
Ritchie passed
away</a>
in his Google+ stream. In his post he says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just heard that, after a long illness, Dennis Ritchie (dmr) died
at home this weekend. I have no more information.</p>
<p>I trust there are people here who will appreciate the reach of his
contributions and mourn his passing appropriately.</p>
<p>He was a quiet and mostly private man, but he was also my friend,
colleague, and collaborator, and the world has lost a truly great
mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who don't know, Dennis Ritchie is one of the inventors of the
C language and UNIX. Much of computing today stand on the foundations
built by this great man. Without C, we wouldn't have high level
languages. Without UNIX, Operating Systems (including Linux, Mac OS and
BSD) wouldn't have reached the state it has today. We owe a lot to him
and it's with sadness that we receive this news.</p>
<p>RIP, dmr.</p>
<p>Update : If you're looking for<a class="reference external" href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/">Dennis Ritchie's
