online.</div>

<div class="line">Hi folks! :)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On March 31, 2009 we opened up release 1.0 of our site to the world wide
web. It was surely a proud moment for all of us at SmartCrowds who
worked so hard towards it. If you haven't already, I urge you to check
it out. Don't forget to leave the feedback at the bottom of the page in
the feedback form.</p>
<p>OK, What are we all about you ask? Most communication today associated
with brands and consumers is one - way. Brands blast the airwaves with
commercials and adverts. The consumer has rants which he blogs about or
posts on different fora. How do we close the loop? How we do we make the
communication more interactive? BrandAdda is our answer to this problem.
Here you can air your views regarding what you love/hate about something
and the brand reps will listen to you.. and respond! You are absolutely
nuts about Apple's 1984 Mac commercial? Post a youtube link and let the
world know. Wanna hear what the twitter world is talking about Apple?
Hear Hear.. There are lots of things you can do on BrandAdda. We
genuinely hope that this will address the big gap between customers and
companies today.</p>
<p>This release brings a lot of changes to the UI. Some features were taken
out that seemed to be unused or confusing to the users. We added some
features to make the whole experience much better for the user.
Visually, I believe the site to be much more appealing than it was
before.</p>
<p>For me personally this release meant some long nights and weekends I was
working while my friends were enjoying themselves. But I feel happy I
made those sacrifices, because the end product is so awesome that it
really makes me proud. I personally believe we've now got a product that
can really take off. What it needs is for the people out there to know
about it. Would appreciate it if you can help the word spread. If you
are a registered user at BrandAdda you can invite your friends by email
and get extra points for it :)</p>
<p>Inspite of all the effort we put in, there might still be bugs and
issues. Sorry for that. Please help us by reporting them on the feedback
form at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Well.. there goes the baby into the big bad world. Let's see how she
does :)</p>
<p>ps : The opinions here are my own. They have nothing to do with the
company.</p>
