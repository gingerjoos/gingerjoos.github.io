    <p>So I watched Inception today and here's the once sentence verdict - You
<strong>have</strong> to watch this one. First, the trailer -</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mmkQ7fw-l0g&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I've been a fan of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher
Nolan</a> ever since I
saw <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)">Memento</a>. This one
has only strengthened the respect I have felt for him. In
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception_%28film%29">Inception</a>he
deals with a powerful subject - Dreams. Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a
thief who uses dreams. He creates a world in his victim's dreams and the
victim populates it with his subconsciousness. By designating certain
areas or objects as safe zones, he forces the victim to automatically
store their innermost secrets in that place. He then proceeds to steal
that idea. Now instead of stealing an idea, he's asked to implant one -
an Inception - in exchange for being able to go back to his kids.</p>
<p>Do not expect to sit back and enjoy the movie mindlessly. Christopher
Nolan will push your brain. He'll make you think. You have to let your
mind run with the idea to enjoy the movie thoroughly. Imagine the sheer
power of the concept he's explaining here. The story is superb - I hope
somebody writes a book with this theme if they haven't already. It isn't
complicated enough for you to not understand it. But you have to sit
down and watch this one with some concentration. It's written
brilliantly. It's no mean task to make the audience comfortable with a
complex concept and then run the rest of the film based on it. It's a
tribute to his skill that Nolan is able to pull this off in an
entertaining manner. The film is not slow or dull even in some parts -
it runs pretty tight throughout. The last few minutes particularly make
for edge of the seat watching.</p>
<p>The ending in itself is a masterpiece. The last few seconds of the movie
in itself is so perfect. He does not intend the audience to forget the
movie after they come out of the theatre. By leaving a crucial point to
his audience's imagination he has made a master stroke. The 4th level
dream introduces some twists to the story line in the last few moments -
but in the hands of Nolan it doesn't seem forced or artificial. Lesser
directors would've fumbled there.</p>
<p>The performances by the actors leave no room for complaints. Leonardo di
Caprio makes for an excellent leading man with a brilliant but troubled
mind portrayed effectively. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Cotillard">Marion
Cotillard</a> plays
Cobb's wife Mal. The other main characters have been brilliantly played
by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Page">Ellen Page</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hardy">Tom
Hardy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Watanabe">Ken
Watanabe</a>. Nolan regular
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Caine">Michael Caine</a> makes a
short but well handled performance.</p>
<p>Music by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a>
stands out. The theme manages to convey the tension and the disturbance
of the movie.</p>
