    <p>I get a lot of <a class="reference external" href="misc/ckwl-on-tatkal-railway-ticket#comments">queries regarding ckwl
status</a>. These involve
questions like -
&quot;I got a tatkal ticket of WL 17 in sleeper on train 2833. Today is
24th Feb 2010. and my train is on 26th Feb.?
Total tatkal seats is 229. Is it likely to be confirmed?&quot;</p>
<p>It's tough to answer such a question. There are different factors to
keep in mind.</p>
<p>1. The route in which the train runs. Some routes, like Chennai -
Bangalore route, are busy. Cancellations are probably low here. You are
more likely to get a CKWL status if you book a train in a busy route.</p>
<p>2. The day for which the ticket is booked. Tatkal ticket bookings are
high on Fridays and Sundays. If you look at tatkal bookings in a busy
route like Bangalore &lt;--&gt; Ernakulam, you will find that booking is high
on Fridays for Bangalore --&gt; Ernakulam and high on Sundays for Ernakulam
--&gt; Bangalore.</p>
<p>3. Which train are you travelling on? If you've booked tatkal tickets
for a train which is at a convenient time for most people (for eg.
Island express at 9:45 pm is convenient for those going from Bangalore
--&gt; Ernakulam), then the likelihood of getting a CKWL status is higher
compared to getting a CKWL status on a less conveniently timed train (
There's a train at 5:15 train from Bangalore --&gt; Ernakulam. Not
convenient because most people can't get out of office that early).</p>
<p>4. Occassionally the railways add extra coaches to a train when there's
a big waiting list. Chances are high that your CKWL status becomes
confirmed in that case. I assume this is more likely to happen during
the rush season (summer holidays?).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Some people cancel their tickets at the very last moment.</li>
<li>Some people forget to cancel their tickets</li>
</ol>
<p>I have faced situations where a CKWL 11 did not get converted to a
confirmed ticket. But I've also faced situations where my CKWL 30 ticket
got confirmed. My advice to you is that unless you have a very high CKWL
status, say CKWL 50, you ought to wait till the last moment. You won't
get much if you cancel a tatkal ticket anyway. It's worth a shot.</p>
<p>Mind you, this advice is free and does not come with any guarantees. I'm
not responsible if you wait for a ticket and it does not get confirmed.
